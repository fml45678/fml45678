- Iâ€™m interested in building useful applications for people and myself, and I am also interested in how music and art can use code or how code can use elements from music and art.
- Iâ€™m currently working mostly with React, Next JS, and programming microcontrollers
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to making music or art or developing other projects that I have started like the-stuff-project which is a place to document all of your stuff and share it with a community.
