- 👋 Hi, I’m @fml45678
- 👀 I’m interested in building in useful applications for people and myself, and I am also interested in how music and art can use code or how code can use elements from music and art.
- 🌱 I’m currently working mostly with React, Next JS, and programming microcontrollers
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to making music or art or developing other projects that I have started like the-stuff-project which is a place to document all of your stuff and share it with a community.
- 📫 you can reach me at: Instagram @fml45678 or email massonlemieux@gmail.com
